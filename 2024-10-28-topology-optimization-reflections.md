Welcome to my first academic thought post! This is where I'll share insights and reflections on my research.

## Current Research Focus

My research centers on several key areas:

1. **Topology Optimization** - Developing efficient algorithms for large-scale problems
2. **Reduced-Order Modeling** - Creating adaptive models that balance accuracy and computational cost
3. **Thermal Systems** - Applying optimization techniques to phase change materials

## Recent Insights

Working on the primal-dual approach has revealed some interesting properties:

- The on-the-fly nature allows for dynamic adaptation
- Multi-fidelity strategies provide excellent computational savings
- The framework extends naturally to various physics problems

## Mathematical Framework

The core optimization problem can be expressed as:

```
minimize   J(u, ρ)
subject to  K(ρ)u = f
            0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1
```

Where ρ represents the design variables and u the state field.

## Future Directions

I'm particularly excited about:

- Integration with machine learning techniques
- Applications to thermal energy storage systems
- Handling non-linear contact problems like Kapitza resistance

## Collaboration Opportunities

If you're working on related topics, feel free to reach out! I'm always interested in discussing:

- PDE-constrained optimization
- Reduced-order modeling techniques
- AI for scientific computing
